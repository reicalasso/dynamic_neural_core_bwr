# Fix for PyTorch In-Place Operation Error in DNC

## Problem
We encountered a PyTorch error during the backward pass:
```
one of the variables needed for gradient computation has been modified by an inplace operation
[torch.FloatTensor [1, 32, 64]], which is output 0 of AsStridedBackward0
```

This error occurs when tensor data is modified in-place after being used in the forward pass, which breaks PyTorch's autograd computation graph.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `SimpleMemoryBank.write` method in `basic_dnc.py`. The method was directly modifying the `.data` attribute of parameters in-place:

```python
# Problematic code:
self.K.data[evict_idx] = pooled.detach()
self.V.data[evict_idx] = pooled.detach()
self.salience.data[evict_idx] = (1 - alpha) * self.salience.data[evict_idx] + alpha * avg_attention[evict_idx].detach()
```

These in-place operations on parameter data caused version conflicts in the autograd system.

## Solution
We replaced the in-place operations with safe alternatives that clone the data first, modify the clone, and then reassign it:

```python
# Fixed code:
# Avoid in-place operations to prevent gradient computation errors
K_updated = self.K.data.clone()
V_updated = self.V.data.clone()
salience_updated = self.salience.data.clone()

K_updated[evict_idx] = pooled.detach()
V_updated[evict_idx] = pooled.detach()

# ... update salience ...

# Update the parameters
self.K.data = K_updated
self.V.data = V_updated
self.salience.data = salience_updated
```

## Key Principles for Avoiding In-Place Operation Errors

1. **Avoid direct modification of `.data` attribute** - Instead, clone, modify, and reassign
2. **Use functional operations** - Replace `x += y` with `x = x + y`
3. **Clone tensors before modification** - Use `tensor.clone()` when you need to modify a tensor that's part of the computation graph
4. **Use `torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)`** - Enable this during debugging to locate the exact source of in-place operation errors

## Verification
The fix was verified by running the training script successfully without any in-place operation errors.
