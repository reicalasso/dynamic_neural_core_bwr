# BWR-DNC 002: Refined Dynamic Neural Core

This is a clean implementation of the Dynamic Neural Core architecture, incorporating lessons learned from previous versions while avoiding key mistakes.

## Key Improvements

1. **Clean Modular Architecture**: Well-defined separation of concerns
2. **Complete Documentation**: Every module is thoroughly documented
3. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient implementations without nested loops
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for all components
5. **Simplified Usage**: Easy-to-use APIs for both research and production

## Project Structure

- `core/` - Core model implementations
- `memory/` - Memory management systems
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `research/` - Research-specific tools and analysis
- `api/` - REST API and WebSocket interfaces
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite
- `examples/` - Usage examples and tutorials

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Start API server
python -m api.server
```
